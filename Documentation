 # Documentations:
The documentation is a crucial component of the project since it gives readers and 
developers a better understanding of what the project does and what has been accomplished.
Our intention is to document every stage that has been accomplished in the project, even if certain phases have not yet been finished.
We label these stages as incompelete so that readers will understand that, for instance, these stages are still in progress.
