 Developer Documentation:
Typically created by the developers who are familiar with the programming and technical aspects of the system. The documentation is intended to provide guidance and instructions to other programmers on how to work with the system's code. To help organize the documentation, wikis may be used, and the documentation can typically be found within the system's design document.
